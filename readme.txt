College project by Denis Kealy for module CA400, Dublin City University.

For this project I created a 3D Virtual Reality experience using Unity 3D, Blender,
RUIS toolkit, Oculus Rift DK2, Kinect 2.0 & a wireless gamepad controller.

Scripts written in C#.

I uploaded the most recent version of the project which was used for my demonstration.
I split it up into seperate commits (uploaded 4th Jan/17).

Code was written and submitted May 2016.
