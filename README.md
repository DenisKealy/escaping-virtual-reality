## Overview

For my final year undergraduate project, I designed and devel- oped a 3D game using the Unity game engine—a Virtual Real- ity puzzle solving experience. I utilised Microsoft’s Kinect and an Oculus Rift headset, combined with a gamepad for finer in- put, to immerse the player in an interactive virtual environment where the player’s movements were mirrored by their avatar. This project focused on the discovery and testing of new interaction models for novel and emerging hardware. I presented a demon- stration consisting of a user testing sandbox and two game levels. I used an open source library to coordinate communication be- tween the devices and customized the codebase to incorporate 3 methods of input. All scripting was implemented in C# and for 3D modelling I used a combination of free assets and models that I built using Blender. Each environment and game level had its own immersive backing track, which I wrote and produced for the demonstration.

Examination and demonstration was conducted in May 2016.
